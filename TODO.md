TODO:
- pull from master and get latest version of contentful data
- better offline development story
- cms-view and cms-view-default need to be collapsed somehow and the slug/content query abstracted so it can work on all content type with slug. Any content type with slug should be able to be rendered to a standalone page via cms-view. The fragment for the component should be sotred in the compennt object itself.
- add some live photo and the livephoto JS form apple to the static folder for development pre-cms based images. I suspect the live photo will be content type in CMS with slug, title, image and video.
- build out page_layouts and include our modifcations to html.js
- In contentful view, there should be a drop down menu for various page view types.
- Find naming / folder convention for react code.
- Sync this TODO.md with github issues in Chicago.
